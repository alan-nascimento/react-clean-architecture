# **ReactJS Clean Architecture**

The purpose of this application was to build a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD as the working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.

> ## Principles

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Open Closed Principle (OCP)
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
* Separation of Concerns (SOC)
* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
* You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
* Keep It Simple, Silly (KISS)
* Composition Over Inheritance
* Small Commits

> ## Design Patterns

* Factory
* Adapter
* Composite
* Decorator
* Dependency Injection
* Composition Root
* Builder
* Proxy
